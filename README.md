# Harris & Pierce

Since Benjamin Harris and Richard Pierce published the first newspaper in America in 1690, access to information has
never been easier. Harris & Pierce helps you to sort the content that matters to you so you save time searching for
relevant resources.

This repo is the improved version of the original website www.harrispierce.com. It was designed as a (serious) social
network where users can 'like' or 'send' articles to their friends. They can 'follow' leaders and see what articles
they read or liked.

Natural Language Processing techniques will soon be implemented to enable articles to be sorted by topics. Topics will
of course be updated on a regular basis depending on what newspapers highlight.

The website was designed using the Django framework and Bootstrap for the frontend.
The scraping scripts were written in Python. News and user profile data is stored in PSQL databases.
The website will soon be deployed using Heroku.

Enjoy!
